Description: bar code scanner and decoder (utilities)
 ZBar is a library for scanning and decoding bar codes from various sources
 such as video streams, image files or raw intensity sensors. It supports
 EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.
 .
 This package contains basic applications for decoding captured bar code images
 and using a video4linux device (e.g. webcam) as a bar code scanner.
