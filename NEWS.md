ZBar Barcode Reader News
========================

Version 0.23
============

  Update ZBar for it to work with updated library versions, making it
  compatible with either Gtk2 or Gtk3 and either Python2 or Python3.
  As part of the new port, it is now possible to use ZBar Gtk bindings
  not only with python2/python3, but also on other languages, as it now
  uses GObject Introspection- GIR, with is a method to allow using libraries
  developed on one language on others. Several languages support it.
  On Windows side, support for DirectShow was added.

===========================

  Some fixes to another set of Windows issues and to support Java 11.

  Some fixes to allow building ZBar on Windows with MinGw.

Version 0.22 (2019-02-20)

  where the Image module is now inside PIL.

Version 0.20 (2017-04-11)
=========================

  As upstream didn't have any version since 2009, created a ZBar fork at
  linuxtv.org. This release improves a lot V4L2 support, by using libv4l2
  to handle formats that are alien to ZBar, making it compatible with a lot
  more webcam models. Qt support was also updated, making it compatible
  with Qt5. ZBar now have two other GUI applications (zbarcam-qt and
  zbarcam-gtk). With zbarcam-qt, it is now possible to adjust the camera
  controls, making easier to read barcodes using a camera.

=========================

  ZBar goes 2D!  This release introduces support for QR Code, developed

  processing master, providing this sophisticated functionality using
  only integer arithmetic and maintaining an extremely small image
  size.  Feel free to drop in on #zbar over at freenode to welcome
  Timothy (aka derf) to the project and congratulate him on his awesome
  work.
