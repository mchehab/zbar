ZBAR BAR CODE READER
====================

ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar codes
from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity
sensors. It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 93, Code 39,
Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.  Included with the library are basic
applications for decoding captured bar code images and using a video device
(e.g. webcam) as a bar code scanner.  For application developers, language
bindings are included for C, C++, Python and Perl as well as GUI widgets for
Qt, GTK and PyGTK.

BUILDING
========

NOTE: this is a simplified version of what it was done in order to do the
Travis CI builds. You may use this as a guide, but the instructions here
may be incomplete. If you find inconsistencies, feel free to submit patches
improving the building steps.

Also, please notice that the instructions here is for a minimal version,
without any bindings nor ImageMagick.

Building on Ubuntu Bionic
-------------------------

You need to install the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install -y \
	autoconf automake autotools-dev libdbus-1-dev \
	pkg-config binutils-mingw-w64-i686 gcc-mingw-w64 \
	mingw-w64-i686-dev mingw-w64-common win-iconv-mingw-w64-dev \
	xmlto

Then, build Zbar with:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig

    autoreconf -vfi

    CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
	--prefix=/usr/local/win32 --with-directshow \
	--without-gtk --without-python --without-qt --without-java \
	--without-imagemagick --enable-pthread

    make


Building natively on Windows
----------------------------

It is possible to build it natively on Windows too.

You need first to setup a building environment with minGw. One way would
be to use Chocolatey to download what's needed:

  * https://chocolatey.org/

With Cocolatey installed, ensure that you have minGw and needed deps with:

    choco install -r --no-progress -y msys2 make

Then use pacman to install the needed packages:

    pacman -Syu --noconfirm autoconf libtool automake make \
	autoconf-archive pkg-config

Once you have everything needed and set the PATH to the places where the
building environment is, you can build ZBar with:

    autoreconf -vfi

    ./configure \
	--host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/usr/local/win32 \
	--without-gtk --without-python --without-qt --without-java \
	--without-imagemagick --enable-pthread \
	 --with-directshow --disable-dependency-tracking

    make


RUNNING
=======

This version of the package includes *only command line programs*.
(The graphical interface is scheduled for a future release)

Invoke Start -> Programs -> ZBar Bar Code Reader -> Start ZBar Command Prompt
to open a shell that has the zbarimg and zbarcam commands available
(in the PATH).

To start the webcam reader using the default camera, type:

    zbarcam

To decode an image file, type e.g.:

    zbarimg -d examples\barcode.png

For basic command instructions, type:

    zbarimg --help
    zbarcam --help

Check the manual for more details.


REPORTING BUGS
==============
